# Yamico--@kurohune538

Hi! I'm Yamico -- working as a design/art engineer in Tokyo, Japan. 

Also CEO of DesignCat Inc. and CDO(Chief Design Officer) of Eukarya Inc.

Previously worked on the biggest Japanese Human Resources Company as an UX designer and engineer.

My research theme is **Human Augmentation**.

From September 2020, I will start to study "Art Engineering" for my research theme on NYU ITP.

I'm crazy about Japanese pop and kawaii culture(e.g anime, manga, music etc...) :pleading_face: :pleading_face: :pleading_face:
